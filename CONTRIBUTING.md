# Contributing to this library

I'll keep things simple as this library unfortately is not actively maintained due to lack of people and time.
I will try to keep it up to date as much as I can.

If you find this library useful and want to improve I welcome you very much :)
However I do want to keep quality up as much as possible.

I've added style linting in accordance with PSR2. And unit testing with phpunit v9.
This supports php7.3 and 7.4
